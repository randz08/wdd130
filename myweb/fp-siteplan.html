            <h2>Heads up: The MMDA is now eyeing an expanded number coding scheme</h2>
            <p>Yesterday, the Metro Manila Council (MMC) unanimously decided to downgrade the National Capital
                Region (NCR) to Alert Level 1. NCR mayors have already sent their recommendation to the
                Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), and we could
                see the new restrictions in effect by March 1.</p>

            <p>If the rider figures in an accident, he or she may also avail of legal assistance, ambulance
                service, hospital admission, and accident coordination with the different government agencies

                In the event the motorbike repair will take longer than 48 hours as claimed by the repair shop,
                the program will cover the rider's lodging and travel expenses for up to two nights based on an
                agreed rate of P2,000 per night. Ibero can arrange an alternate means of transportation that
                will take the rider to his destination or reimburse his transportation expenses. </p>
