                    <h3>Colorado River Rafting:</h3>
                    <p>The Most famous of course is the Colorado River. The Colorado River is the lifeblood of the
                        entire
                        southwestern United States. Its powerful waters that start high on the Continental Divide in
                        Colorado surge down the mountains and through Americaâ€™s great Southwestern deserts all the way
                        to Mexico.
                        The river feeds thousands of communities along the way. </p>

                    <h3>Cataract Canyon Rafting</h3>
                    <p>Deep within the boundaries of Canyonlands National Park, Cataract Canyon offers a perfect balance
                        between
                        serene floating, incredible hiking, and fast-moving rapids. 300 million years of rock history,
                        abstract sculpted sandstone spires, and ancient Anasazi petroglyphs and granaries grace Cataract
                        Canyon. </p>

                    <p>Westwater Canyon is a proposed Wild & Scenic River and combines all the components of a classic
                        river trip:
                        excellent whitewater, charming campsites, and great hikes. Part of the time you will drift
                        leisurely at the
                        rivers pace; then there is one day of extremely fun rapids. The Colorado River forces its way
                        into narrow
                        Black Granite Gorge forming renowned rapids like Little Hummer, Funnel Falls, Last Chance and
                        the infamous
                        Skull Rapid.</p>

                    <h3>Moab Rafting (Fisher Towers)</h3>
                    <p>The fisher towers section is a beautiful stretch of the Colorado River, with moderate class I-II
                        rapids suitable
                        for everyone. Boat options include oarboats, inflatable kayaks, and sometimes paddleboats. Mild
                        Rapids make
                        this section of the Colorado River especially fun for beginning rafters and perfect for young
                        families.
                        The river is wide and warm, making swimming extremely inviting on those very warm summer days.
