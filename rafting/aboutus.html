                <p>Environmental responsibility is an ethic everyone in the company lives and teaches.
                    We leave no trace of our passage; we “take only pictures and leave only footprints.”
                    We have a much extended recycling program. This includes reusing all plastics on trips
                    from Gatorade bottles to sour cream containers. Returned brochures are sent to travel
                    agents and are placed in rack holders. SGE recycles everything else. All faxes and printers
                    use recycled paper. All our meals are prepared fresh. Many of our vegetables are from our
                    own garden. We commission local farmers to grow fresh produce, keeping jobs at home.
                    Our meats and chesses are from local Ye Ol’ Geezer Meats in Moab, Utah.</p>
                <p>Travel to Rafting guides and staff are encouraged to contribute to the local
                    community in a variety of ways. We pay for half of all volunteer hours anyof our employees
