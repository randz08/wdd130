                    <h3>Rates Include:</h3>
                    <p>1. All inclusive trips: Whatever your trip choice, you'll find that we pack every trip with first
                        class amenities,
                        all included in the trip price. (Some outfitters impose additional fees for camping gear and
                        rafting equipment,
                        but we don’t!) It's adventure made easy. All you have to do is show up!</p>
                    <p>2. Camping Gear: We make camping simple. All you need to worry about is packing your personal
                        items in a soft-sided duffle bag.
                        We’ll supply the rest: Including a deluxe Sleeping Kit (clean sleeping bag & thick pad), and a
                        high quality clean 2 person tent.

                    <p>4. HIKING/Explore: All our trips offer experiential experiences and wonders just off the rivers
                        edge.
