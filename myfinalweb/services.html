            <h1>What is Road 'BAYANIHAN' Help and Why Should I Get It?</h1>
            <p>From engine trouble to loosen your keys</p>
            <div class="box">
                As the summer season reaches its peak, expect to see more two wheelers to hit the road. However,
                more motorcycles on the streets also mean more possible roadside emergencies. So why travel with a
                motorbike if it comes with a lot of worries?
                <img class="articlepic" src="images/RBH-service-center-645.jpg" width="150" alt="placeholder">
                To make sure that these concerns won't get in the way between you and your dream long ride and
                vacation, RBH's local distributor, Adventure Cycle Philippines Inc. (ACPI), forged a partnership
                with Ibero Asistencia, a global company that specializes in roadside travel assistance.

                This collaboration means that a purchase of any street-legal KTM motorbike from May 1, 2018 to April
                30, 2019 entitles the owner to a free 24/7 emergency road assistance program. According to ACPI
                marketing division head Ana Lourdes Lumban, RBH riders who avail of the program can seek assistance
                for different motorcycle issues like engine trouble, towing, and removal of damaged unit.

        <h2>Vehicle Assistance</h2>

    <h3>Battery jumpstart</h3>
    <p> When the car can’t start due to a dead battery, this type of assistance comes

    </p>

            <h2>Should I Get Roadside Assistance Coverage?</h2>
            <h3>1. Less Hassle While Driving</h3>
            <p>When your vehicle stalls, you can just call your car insurance company and have it towed to a
                repair shop without
                worrying about bothering your family or friends. If an MMDA’s accredited towing company is the
                one that tows your
                stalled car, you’ll be issued a traffic violation ticket.</p>
            <h3>2. The Danger of an Overheating Engine</h3>
            <p>The extremely hot weather in the Philippines, especially during summer, raises the risk of
                overheating.
                More so if you aren’t maintaining your vehicle properly. You can count on your roadside
                assistance coverage
                when your engine is about to overheat. If your temperature gauge reads high, don’t drive any
                further—pull over
                to the roadside and switch off your engine. Then call your insurance provider’s 24/7 hotline to
                request
                a tow truck that will bring your car to the nearest repair shop.</p>
            <h3>3. Avoid Expensive Repair Bills</h3>
            <p>The fuel delivery service can save you when you’re low on gas and there’s no nearby gasoline
                station.
                It helps you prevent your car from running out of fuel, a scenario that can cause engine damage
                and costly repair.</p>
            <h3>4. Peace of Mind</h3>
            <p>That dreaded car breakdown or accident can cause so much inconvenience and make you feel helpless
                while you’re stranded.
                Wouldn’t you want the peace of mind knowing you’ll get immediate help when you need it
                desperately?</p>
